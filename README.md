# MicrobeDataTools

\- in development -

MicrobeDataTools is an R package develloped by the POLA3R-team (part of the LifeWatch-ERIC Belgium infrastructure and the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences) to ease the open online archiving and re-use of molecular ('omics) microbial datasets. This package contains functions to:
1.	quality control microbial datasets (e.g. standardize dates and coordinates,...)
2.	format environmental measurement data associated with sequences in compliance with MIxS or DarwinCore
3.	upload standardized environmental measurement along with the sequence data to ENA
4.	download sequence data from International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) together with any associated metadata or environmental measurement data
